# User Guide for Las Vegas Royale

## Description
Welcome to Las Vegas Royale developed by The Scrum Bucket. The 
computer game is based on the Las Vegas Royale Board Game. We 
hope you enjoy the game and leave a Review!

## Objective
Have the most money at the end of the game to win.

## How to Play
When your dice are rolled, you will have the ability to choose 
what dice face you want to use by inputting the desired die 
face. If you input something other than a single integer
or a dice face unavailable to you, you will get an invalid input
and have to input again. Chips are used by inputting 0 if they 
are available.
